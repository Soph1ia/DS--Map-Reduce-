"No it cannot be!"                                                      "And does he not live in the Champs-Elysees?"
"Are you my friend, Caderousse?"                                        "Yes, No. 30."
"Yes, in life or death."                                                "Ah," said Caderousse, "No. 30."
"Well, I will tell you a secret."                                       "Yes, a fine house standing alone, between a court-yard and

"What is it?"
"Possibly; but it is not the exterior I care for, it is the interior.
"But remember" --
What beautiful furniture there must be in it!"
"Ah, pardieu, mute as a carp."
"Have you ever seen the Tuileries?"
"Well, I think" -- Andrea stopped and looked around.
"No."
"You think? Do not fear; pardieu, we are alone."
"Well, it surpasses that."

"The rooms are all carpeted."
"He quietly said, `What do I care if I am?'"
"Well, then, I must be contented to imagine it."
"Andrea, he has some secretary with a spring."
"That is the best plan, believe me."

"Middling."
"And he is not robbed?"
"How is it arranged?"
"No; his servants are all devoted to him."
"Faith, I should require pen, ink, and paper to make a plan."
"There ought to be some money in that secretary?"
"They are all here," said Caderousse, briskly. He fetched
from an old secretary a sheet of white paper and pen and ink.         "There may be. No one knows what there is."
